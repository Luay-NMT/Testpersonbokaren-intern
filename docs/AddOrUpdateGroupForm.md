The `AddOrUpdateGroupForm` component is a form component that displays a dialog for creating or updating a group. It uses Material-UI components such as `Button`, `TextField`, `Dialog`, `DialogTitle`, `DialogContent`, `DialogContentText`, `DialogActions`, `CheckCircleIcon`, `CancelIcon`, and `styled` to create the form UI. It imports API functions named `newGroup()`, and `updateGroup()` from a file located at `'../APICalls'`.

## Props

The `AddOrUpdateGroupForm` component accepts the following props:

- `open` (boolean): A boolean indicating whether the form should be open or closed.
- `onClose` (function):  A callback function that is called when the dialog is closed, either by clicking the cancel button or clicking outside of the dialog.
- `onConfirm`(function): A callback function that will be called when the confirm button of the dialog is clicked and the form data is valid.
- `groupId` (string): A string that represents the ID of the group to be updated.
- `type` (string): A string that indicates whether the form is used for creating a new group or updating an existing group.
- `title` (string): A string that represents the title of the form.
- `name` (string): A string that represents the name of the group.
- `setName`(function): A function that sets the name of the group.
- `shortName` (string): A string that represents the short name of the group.
- `setShortName`(function): A function that sets the short name of the group.

## State

The `AddOrUpdateGroupForm` component defines the following state variables using the useState hook:

- `isShortNameInvalid` (boolean): A boolean that indicates whether the short name input field has an invalid value.
- `isNameInvalid` (boolean): A boolean that indicates whether the name input field has an invalid value.

## Functions

The `AddOrUpdateGroupForm` component contains the following functions:
- `setInitialState` : A function that resets the form state variables to their initial values.
- `handleSubmit` : A function is called when the user clicks the submit button. It first checks whether the input fields are invalid, and sets the corresponding error flags if they are. If both input fields are not invalid, it checks whether the form is used for creating a new group or updating an existing group, and calls the appropriate API function with the input fields parameters. It then calls the `onConfirm` function, which is passed as a prop to the component, and resets the form data using the `setInitialState` function.
- `StyledButton`: A function is used to create a custom `StyledButton` component that extends the functionality of the `Button` component. The `StyledButton` component is used for the confirm and cancel buttons in the dialog. The `styled` function is called with a template string that contains CSS styles to apply to the `Button` component. In this case, the `text-transform` property is set to `none` to prevent the text inside the button from being capitalized.

## UI

The `AddOrUpdateGroupForm` component renders a dialog using the Material-UI components. The dialog contains a title, a content area with text and input fields for full name and short name. Error messages are displayed below the input fields when the input is invalid. It has two buttons for confirming and closing the dialog. The submit button calls the `handleSubmit` function when clicked, and the cancel button calls the `setInitialState` and `onClose` functions when clicked.
