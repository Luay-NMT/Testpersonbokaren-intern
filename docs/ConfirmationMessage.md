The `ConfirmationMessage` component is a dialog component that renders a dialog box with a confirmation message. It uses Material-UI components such as `Button`, `Dialog`, `DialogTitle`, `DialogContent`, `DialogContentText`, `DialogActions`, `CheckCircleIcon`, and `styled` to create the dialog UI.

## Props
The `ConfirmationMessage` component accepts the following props:
- `open` (boolean): A boolean indicating whether the form should be open or closed.
- `onClose` (function):  A callback function that is called when the dialog is closed, either by clicking the cancel button or clicking outside of the dialog.
- `testpersons` (array): An optional array of testpersons that will be displayed in the dialog box. If this prop is not provided, the dialog box will not display this information.
- `message` (string): A message that will be displayed in the dialog box.
- `title` (string): A title for the dialog box.

## Functions
The `ConfirmationMessage` component contains one function:

- `StyledButton`: A function is used to create a custom `StyledButton` component that extends the functionality of the `Button` component. The `StyledButton` component is used for the confirm button in the dialog. The `styled` function is called with a template string that contains CSS styles to apply to the `Button` component. In this case, the `text-transform` property is set to `none` to prevent the text inside the button from being capitalized.

## UI

The `ConfirmationMessage` component renders a dialog box using the Material-UI components. The dialog contains a title and a content area with a text message and an optional array of testpersons. It has one button for closing the dialog. It calls the `onClose` function when the button is clicked.
