The `AddOrUpdateBookingForm` component is a form component that displays a dialog for adding or updating a booking. It uses Material-UI components such as `Button`, `TextField`, `Dialog`, `DialogTitle`, `DialogContent`, `DialogContentText`, `DialogActions`, `Autocomplete`, `CheckCircleIcon`, `CancelIcon`, and `styled` to create the form UI. It imports API functions named `getAllUsers()`, `newBooking()`, and `updateBooking()` from a file located at `'../APICalls'`.

## Props

The `AddOrUpdateBookingForm` component accepts the following props:

- `open` (boolean): A boolean value indicating whether the dialog should be open or closed.
- `onClose` (function):  A callback function that is called when the dialog is closed, either by clicking the cancel button or clicking outside of the dialog.
- `onConfirm` (function): A callback function that will be called when the confirm button of the dialog is clicked.
- `testpersons` (array): An array of testpersons that will be passed to the API calls for creating or updating a booking.
- `type` (string): A string indicating whether the form is for creating a new booking or updating an existing booking. Possible values are "newBooking" or "updateBooking".
- `title` (string): The title to be displayed in the dialog.
- `name` (string): The value of the name input field in the form.
- `setName` (function): A callback function to set the value of the name input field in the form.
- `email` (string): The value of the email input field in the form.
- `setEmail` (function): A callback function to set the value of the email input field in the form.
- `organisation` (object): An object representing the selected user from the Autocomplete component in the form.
- `setOrganisation` (function): A callback function to set the selected user in the form.
- `inputValue` (string): The value of the input field in the Autocomplete component in the form.
- `setInputValue` (function): A callback function to set the value of the input field in the Autocomplete component in the form.

## State

The `AddOrUpdateBookingForm` component defines the following state variables using the useState hook:

- `isEmailInvalid` (boolean): A boolean value indicating whether the email input field has an invalid value.
- `isNameInvalid` (boolean): A boolean value indicating whether the name input field has an invalid value.
- `isOrganisationInvalid` (boolean): A boolean value indicating whether the organisation Autocomplete component has an invalid value.
- `users` (array): An array of users fetched from an API call using the `getAllUsers` function.

## Functions

The `AddOrUpdateBookingForm` component contains the following functions:

- `setInitialState()`: A function that resets the form state variables to their initial values.
- `handleSubmit` : A function is called when the user clicks the submit button. It first checks whether the input fields are invalid, and sets the corresponding error flags if they are. If both input fields are not invalid, it checks whether the form is used for creating a new booking or updating an existing booking, and calls the appropriate API function with the input fields parameters. It then calls the `onConfirm` function, which is passed as a prop to the component, and resets the form data using the `setInitialState` function.
- `StyledButton`: A function is used to create a custom `StyledButton` component that extends the functionality of the `Button` component. The `StyledButton` component is used for the confirm and cancel buttons in the dialog. The `styled` function is called with a template string that contains CSS styles to apply to the `Button` component. In this case, the `text-transform` property is set to `none` to prevent the text inside the button from being capitalized.

## UI

The `AddOrUpdateBookingForm` component renders a dialog using the Material-UI components. The dialog contains a title, a content area with text and input fields for name, email, and organisation. The Autocomplete component is used for selecting an organisation from a list of users fetched from the API. Error messages are displayed below the input fields when the input is invalid. It has two buttons for confirming the booking and closing the dialog. The submit button calls the `handleSubmit` function when clicked, and the cancel button calls the `setInitialState` and `onClose` functions when clicked.
